The following examples have been made using a sample file with the content of:
```
jeden - one
dwa - two
trzy - three
```

The files used by the program to make a new game are simple .txt files with each line in the text file representing a line to be shown in the game. The words are split using a string of characters designated in the game settings.

#### Example Game in Normal Mode
![Normal_Mode](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/drive-viewer/AKGpihZHrNAHDVYDLJCRQzbqHrCqP7Hgcs7roOPEZ1WRnzx6NcVeZsd9exe336mdbgwop_Ff_7wGe8PABXJ2L70aJDpQ9GSFoegK3_w=s1600-rw-v1)

This is an example of a Normal Mode game. In normal mode, first, the query word is displayed. Upon pressing enter, the answer is shown. If what you thought was the answer is correct, you just press enter again. If you made a mistake, you type anything and then press enter, and the given line will be counted as one with a mistake and stats updated accordingly.

This is an example of a Typing Mode game. In Typing Mode, you have to type out the correct answer, and it is checked automatically. There are settings to make the process of checking less rigorous, making it ignore inappropriate white spaces or encapsulations.
